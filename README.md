Release of source code for simulations for paper by George BIssias and Brian Levine in ISOC NDSS 2020

bt-dblspend.py is a simulation of the double spend attack for various k and rates of attacker mining power. 

bt-selfish.py is a simulation of the selfish mining attack for various k and rates of attacker mining power.

bobtail-all.py is a series of simulations that justify bobtail's design, such as FIFO ordering of other miner's proofs in a 
block, orphan rate, interblock variance, and network traffic.
